# Dream Team

Welcome to the Dream Team app.

With this app you can create your very own dream line-up of basketball players.

/teams page leads you to a page where all teams are shown on a list on the page. Clicking on the teams takes you to another page where the team info is shown and comments can be made about the team. 

The edit button on the /teams/:teamId page will navigate you to /teams/:teamId/edit where you can edit and update the teams info.

The /create-teams page allows you to create a new team from scratch that can be posted on /teams page.
